                   Non-vegetarian (non-veg) is an Indian English word that is used to refer to meaty food and also to a person who is a meatarian not a vegetarian i.e. someone who consumes meat, especially as a major source of protein.[1][2] Although the intended meaning is readily understood, these terms are not common parlance in the Anglosphere (English-speaking countries) where meat consumption is the norm, vegetarianism is a rarity, and veganism is a novelty.
